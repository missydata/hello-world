# hello-world
my first repository

Hello,
I am just another person who do not find satisfaction with my current job. I like engineering work type, the one I can create something from beginning. Having family and living in suburban area, it's hard for me to find the type of work that meet my interest. I happened to listen many podcast and realized that big data is the big thing now. And I started learning coding for data science. I love it. I love coding for each code or project is my baby.
